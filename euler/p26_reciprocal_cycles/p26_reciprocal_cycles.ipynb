Then, we just take slices of the decimal string until we get a matching slice. After we find a matching slice we double check that it's not a result of smaller slices. The digit string for $1/3$ would be \"333333333....\" so if we took s[0:100] == s[100:200] it would be true! But this is a repeating sequence of length 1, not length 100.\n",

    "One final observation and then to the code. Again any repeated decimal can be expressed as a fraction over some number of 9's. So we have $\\frac{1}{d} = \\frac{n}{i}$ where $d$ is some integer, $n$ is some integer, and $i$ is some number of 9's. By multiplying through the denominators, we get: $i = n \\cdot d$. In otherwords, $n$ and $d$ are both factors of $i$. Kind of an interesting fact: For all numbers that aren't divisble by 2 or 5, there exists some number constructed of repeated 9's that it is a factor of. So, all we need to do is to find the length of our number $i$, since that determines how long the repeating cycle is. Here's the code:"
